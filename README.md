## Overview
**CryptoWeather Nexus** is built with **Next.js (v13+)** and **React**, using **Redux** for global state management and **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design. The app features real-time updates for cryptocurrency prices and weather data, providing users with a unified platform for financial and environmental monitoring.

### Features:
- Real-time cryptocurrency data (prices, changes, trends).
- Weather data (current temperature, humidity, conditions).
- City and cryptocurrency pages for detailed exploration.
- Real-time WebSocket notifications for price changes and weather conditions.

## Setup & Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-weather-nexus.git
cd crypto-weather-nexus
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CRYPTO_API_KEY=your_crypto_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=your_websocket_url
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CRYPTO_API_KEY`: Your API key for cryptocurrency data.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY`: Your API key for weather data.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL`: WebSocket URL for real-time notifications.

### 4. Run the Application:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app.

## Usage

- **Explore Cryptocurrencies**: Navigate to the "Cryptocurrencies" section to view live data for various coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.
- **Weather Exploration**: Visit the "Weather" section to check the weather for different cities in real time.
- **Set Alerts**: You can set price and weather alerts to be notified via WebSocket when thresholds are met.

## Design Decisions

- **Next.js & React**: Chosen for their flexibility and ability to easily handle SSR (server-side rendering) and static site generation for fast load times.
- **Redux**: Used for global state management, ensuring efficient data handling across components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework was selected for rapid styling and responsive design.
- **WebSocket**: Used for real-time notifications, keeping users updated on the latest cryptocurrency price changes and weather updates.

## API Integrations

### 1. **Crypto API (CoinGecko)**:
The app uses the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data, including prices, trends, and market data.

- **API Endpoint**: `/coins/markets`
- **Required Parameters**: 
    - `vs_currency`: The currency to compare (e.g., USD).
    - `ids`: A comma-separated list of cryptocurrency IDs (e.g., `bitcoin,ethereum`).

### 2. **Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)**:
The app fetches real-time weather data for various cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.

- **API Endpoint**: `/data/2.5/weather`
- **Required Parameters**: 
    - `q`: The city name (e.g., `London`).
    - `appid`: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.

## Real-Time Notifications

The app uses WebSocket connections for real-time notifications. This allows users to be alerted immediately when:
- A cryptocurrencyâ€™s price reaches a predefined threshold.
- Weather conditions in a specific city change significantly.

### WebSocket Implementation:
- A WebSocket server is set up to broadcast notifications to all connected clients whenever there is a price or weather update.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: **Handling Real-Time Data**
- **Solution**: Implemented WebSocket to manage real-time data for cryptocurrency and weather updates, ensuring users receive instant notifications when changes occur.

### Challenge 2: **Rate Limiting on APIs**
- **Solution**: To handle rate limiting, caching was implemented for API requests to reduce unnecessary load on the servers and improve app performance.

### Challenge 3: **Responsive Design**
- **Solution**: Used Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts to ensure the app functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.
